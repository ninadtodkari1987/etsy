I also work a bit in abstract expressionism.\r\n\r\n**About the Artist:\r\n   I&#39;m a full-time professional artist living in Grovetown, Georgia with my husband and two beautiful children. My award-winning original oil paintings are internationally collected and can be found in private collections all over the world!\r\n    I take a lot of pride in my oil paintings as painting is a skill passed down from my grandfather through my family. Each and every painting gets my full attention until its completion. I spend as long as necessary to perfect each piece and will not let it leave my easel till it is worthy of your wall space!\r\n\r\nTHE LATEST:\r\n   Exhibited in California: Pacific Gallery, Dana Point Harbor, CA\r\n   Exhibited in California: Pacific Gallery, Laguna Beach, CA\r\n   Exhibited in Maryland: Green Owl Gallery, Hyattsville, MD\r\n   Arlington Arts Gallery; Arlington, VA; Springtime Celebration of Artists \r\n   PicassoWhat Art Gallery; Rockland, ME; &quot;The Many Faces of   PicassoWhat&quot;\r\n   Seikilos FX Studios; Dallas, Texas; Featured Artist in Showroom\r\n   PicassoWhat Art Gallery, Rockland, ME; &quot;Artistic Differences&quot;\r\n   PicassoWhat Art Gallery; Rockland, ME; &quot;Picasso Would Have Loved This&quot;\r\n   Find prints of my work in Expressions Art Gallery, La Conner, WA\r\n   Featured at Napolean Bistro & Lounge in Washington DC for the Create A Cure project.\r\n   Featured at the RAW: DC Showcase in Washington DC.\r\n   Interviewed on Etsy Conversations Podcast\r\n   Named as one of the Top 5 artists in Washington, DC for the RAW 2012 Season.\r\n   Cover art for Eric Anschutz&#39;s book, &quot;November Song&quot;\r\n   Artwork used on the set of NBC&#39;s TV series &quot;Save Me.&quot;\r\n  &quot;The Custom Art Collection: Art for the Contemporary Home&quot; for sale at Barnes & Noble \r\nand featuring my artwork.\r\n\r\nPRESS:\r\nFeatured in &quot;The Custom Art Collection: Art for the Contemporary Home&quot; \r\nFeatured in the Kreative Corner section of Kreative Living \r\nArticle in Washington Post: http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/2012/07/29/gJQAMa95IX_story.html\r\n\r\nCUSTOM ART:\r\nI am currently booked for the remainder of 2018.

Please contact for questions.\r\n \r\n***Caring for Your New Piece of Contemporary Art ***\r\n♥Paintings that are relatively new are more fragile to the touch. It can take up to a year for an oil painting to become completely chemically dried (cured) so be sure to carefully handle your oil painting at all times. \r\n\r\n♥When dusting, use a cloth or feather duster or even lightly forced air as it can be very easy to scratch your painting when it is fresh.\r\n\r\n♥Oil paintings need to &quot;breathe&quot; in order to cure properly. Thus, it is important not enclose them in a frame without ventilation and be sure to leave an inch of space between the glass and the painting, should you choose to put your painting behind glass.\r\n\r\n♥Don&#39;t position your painting in extreme lighting situations. Extreme light or dark may effect the way the painting cures and either give it a washed out look or a yellowed look.\r\n\r\n♥With proper care, your oil painting can easily last for generations and be a piece of unique, original art to treasure forever!",

One such organization we feel is doing a world of good is Ryan’s Case for Smiles.  They help alleviate some of the stress and emotional impact of illness by providing whimsical pillowcases to children.  For every purchase you make at Tayberry, we are proud to donate two handmade pillowcases to Ryan’s Case for Smiles.  To read more about the organization please see their website:  http://caseforsmiles.org/",

        "policy_additional": "SIZING DETAILS\nWe currently offer items ranging in size from 6 months to 6 years.  We do list the measurements for each particular clothing piece on the listing page details. The chest measurement is from armpit to armpit. The length measurement is from the top of the shoulder to the bottom hem. Children of the same age can vary greatly in size. It is highly recommended that to ensure a proper fit you measure a similar piece of non-stretch clothing that currently fits and compare it to the measurements given above.\n\nWHEN WILL MY ITEMS SHIP OUT?\nSame day shipping is Monday through Friday (excluding postal holidays).  Monday through Friday order need to be placed before 12PM EST to ship out same day.  Orders placed after 12PM EST on Friday and orders placed on Saturday or Sunday will be shipped out first thing Monday morning.\n\nPlease read &quot;Shipping and Delivery&quot; for more information.\n\nSHIPPING AND DELIVERY\nWe ship through USPS.  WHAT WE CAN GUARANTEE: We can guarantee when we will ship the order out.  We can guarantee that we will obtain a receipt from USPS as we hand deliver every item at the USPS counter.  WHAT WE CANNOT GUARANTEE:  We cannot guarantee when USPS will deliver your order.  Once the package is out of our possession and in the hands of USPS, it is under their control.  We, understandably, do not have any control over USPS. It is USPS&#39;s responsibility to delivery the item on the estimated delivery date.  Most of the time these estimates are good but sometimes, through USPS, packages do get delayed.  We recommend for time sensitive orders to place well in advance and/or use a faster (even guaranteed) service through USPS.\n\nCOLOR\nDue to the many variations in monitors and browsers, colors may appear different on different monitors. If you are looking for an exact color match, we offer a sample service, so please contact us for details.\n\nCAN I ORDER SOMETHING IN A DIFFERENT SIZE?\nAll of our handmade clothing pieces are one of a kind. We use rare, hard to find fabrics for our creations. This one of a kind fashion adds to the special quality of each piece we create. Since our fabric choices are rare we are limited in the amount we can obtain and we regret that we cannot create our clothing pieces in different sizes.",

The vast majority of my pieces are created with surgical steel, and I am moving into using 24k gold plating as well.\n\nJEWELRY CARE\nResin Jewelry - \n- Try to keep your resin jewelry away from lotions and sprays (ex, suntan lotion), as these can affect the finish and shine of the resin.\n- The resin I use when creating jewelry is some of the hardest available, but try not to scratch the resin as it may leave a mark.\n- I use UV resistant resin, but to be on the safe side I recommend storing your resin jewelry in a cool, dry place.\n- To clean your resin jewelry, use a soft clean cloth.\nMetal Jewelry -\n- All metal jewelry can tarnish, and it usually depends on what lotions you wear/oiliness of your skin.\n- To clean, use dish soap and a soft clean cloth, or a jewelry cleaner.\n- Store your jewelry in a cool, dry place. \n\n*I recommend against showering in your W + B jewelry.",

Please do not cut open the envelope, as you may inadvertently cut the papercut.\n\nPAPERCUTS- WHAT HAPPENS IF MY PAPERCUT ARRIVES DAMAGED?\nHOPEFULLY, this will not happen. The rigid mailing envelopes should stop the papercut from being folded, but there is the possibility that if the weather is inclement and your parcel gets wet in your mailbox/at your door etc, that damage may occur to the papercut inside. If it does, please contact me and send a photo of the damage and I will send you a replacement as soon as possible.\n\nCAN I PURCHASE A COMMERCIAL USE LICENCE FOR ONE OF YOUR PAPERCUT DESIGNS?\nNo, you cannot. Although you may make multiple cuts of any file you purchase, you may not sell anything made using my design or sell or share the file itself- even if you alter the file.\nIf you have a customer who would like to purchase a finished papercut using my file, please direct them to my Etsy store, where they are available for purchase.\n\nPAPERCUTS- DO YOU SELL &#39;SECONDS&#39; OF YOUR PAPERCUTS?\nOccasionally, I accidentally cut through a delicate area of a papercut. If this happens and I decide to sell the item, it will be listed as a &#39;second&#39; with clear photographs and dscriptions of any of my errors.\nAny papercuts that are sold as seconds are sold as is and not eligible for returns, refunds or replacement.\nAs such, they are heavily discounted at 50%.\n\nI NEED A BIRTHDAY PRINTABLE FAST. DO YOU CHARGE A RUSH-FEE?\nNO. I do not charge for rush-orders- in my opinion, that is just cheeky! My MAXIMUM turnaround is 2 days, but I almost always have the file ready within 24 hours (usually sooner). You can speed up the process by using the Etsy app with notifications turned on or checking your email frequently (check your Etsy notifications aren&#39;t going to your spam folder).\nIf you need your files before that, just flick me an Etsy message BEFORE you order and let me know you&#39;re in a rush. If I am able, I will create your files immediately (or as soon as possible- I will let you know when I can). Please keep in mind that I am in Australia, so it is unlikely I will be able to complete your order immediately if it is the wee hours of the morning where I live.",

Just use sanding paper, sponges or steel wool to smooth the edges. \n\nAluminum is a great alternative to sterling silver. Aluminum is a lighter material that does not rust, change color or tarnish , is safe for skin (it actually has a much lower rate of allergic reaction than silver), and will hold up to everyday use.  And because it is so durable, items crafted with it can be treasured for a lifetime.\n\n\n*** Note that these pieces do not have holes. You will need a hole punch to be able to hang them.\n\n*** I will do my best to prevent scratches in transit. If that happens,you will need a polish pad to remove any light scratches on the surface.\n\n*** Blanks may look large in pictures please make sure to  read all measurements provided to get an idea of actual size.\n\n*** The blanks are in stock and usually ready to ship within 1 business day. \n\n*** Please message me if you would like more than the quantity listed. I can produce custom orders within 2 days.\n\n*** Order additional items or quantities to save on shipping fees. \n\n*** Please let me know if you have any other questions.",
