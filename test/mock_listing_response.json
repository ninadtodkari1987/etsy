Please contact for questions.\r\n \r\n***Caring for Your New Piece of Contemporary Art ***\r\n♥Paintings that are relatively new are more fragile to the touch. It can take up to a year for an oil painting to become completely chemically dried (cured) so be sure to carefully handle your oil painting at all times. \r\n\r\n♥When dusting, use a cloth or feather duster or even lightly forced air as it can be very easy to scratch your painting when it is fresh.\r\n\r\n♥Oil paintings need to &quot;breathe&quot; in order to cure properly. Thus, it is important not enclose them in a frame without ventilation and be sure to leave an inch of space between the glass and the painting, should you choose to put your painting behind glass.\r\n\r\n♥Don&#39;t position your painting in extreme lighting situations. Extreme light or dark may effect the way the painting cures and either give it a washed out look or a yellowed look.\r\n\r\n♥With proper care, your oil painting can easily last for generations and be a piece of unique, original art to treasure forever!",
